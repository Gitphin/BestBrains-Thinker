Additionally, you can download and extract this project as a **ZIP**

## Step 1: Download Python and Scratch

**Mac:** It may or may not work, currently not sure because I have not tested it.

**Linux:** You can type **> sudo apt install python3** or download it with your package manager

### Scratch<br>
Download Scratch from the official website: [Scratch Download](https://scratch.mit.edu/download)

**Note:** The installation paths vary based on where the applications are downloaded, affecting how the program opens files. <br>Additionally, Scratch does **NOT** run on Linux (maybe on a VM or Wine?)

## Step 2: Running the Tool
Locate the executable file _BestBrains Thinker.exe_ inside the _BestBrains Thinker_ folder.

On Windows, it will be the file with the type "Application", which you can click on and run to bring up the tool.

For easy access to the tool, create a **shortcut**:

Right-click on _BestBrains Thinker.exe_.
Select **"Create a shortcut"**.
(Optional) Rename the shortcut to anything you prefer for convenience.

## Final Notes:
There has been an issue with Windows detecting a Wacatac trojan in the tool. This is a false-positive, as <br>
I have checked thoroughly and can confirm it has to do with a common issue due to pyinstaller. If you <>
are unsure please feel free to research this issue or contact me for any concerns. 

For now, I have disabled the mode with Pyinstaller that hides terminal as that is what seems to have been causing the issue. 
If anyone has a solution to this issue and they are willing to provide some wisdom please reach out to me.
